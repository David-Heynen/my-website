    <p>Hello, my name is David Heynen. A little about myself is that I am a hard worker, self-motivated, and willing to challenge myself with new ideas. I enjoy creating new things from scratch, which is why I went into Computer Science. I created this simple website mainly to show my skills and talents through projects that I have developed on my own or with others.</p>
